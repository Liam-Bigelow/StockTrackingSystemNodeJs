# StockTrackingSystemNodeJs
This is a backend application for a stock market tracking system where userâ€™s can trade stocks or shares written in node.js

_Note: this is currently unfinished. The only testable code is login/logout_

### TASKS TO SOLVE
* Your system should have support for users to login/logout.
  * Can use a passport local authorization
* Users should be able to add balance to their wallet.
  * Balance should be stored in the user schema
* Users should be able to buy/sell shares (transactions need not be stored)
  * Stocks should be a collection with shares bought for each stock.
* Users should be able to subscribe to an endpoint that should provide live rates.
  * If using a socket we could have a pre-save hook on the Stock Schema that emits a socket message to the client.
  * if using polling we could have a route that accepts a stock id or symbol which will return the live rate
* Users should have the ability to see their portfolio
  * A Share should be its own Schema and sub-document within a Stock.
  * This way the portfolio is just querying the database for all Shares with the users unique id attached to them
